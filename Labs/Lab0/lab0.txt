Problem 1:
1) I am Korean but was born and raised in Indonesia, so I find myself relating more with indonesians/third-culture community.
2) I want to create a startup/business in the future.
3) I used to think that I was going to be a chemical engineer but found myself changing majors in freshman spring.
