1.b. 
The parent and the child each have their own copies of num as processes do not share information.

2.a. 
i and x exist in the data segment (global and static variables)

pid and y exist in the stack segment (function calls, local variables, and return address)

2.b. 
1) The parent's data and stack segments are copied over to the child.
2) The changes to these variables made by the child are NOT seen by the parent.

2.d.
1) Yes, if one process closes the file, the other can still read from it.
2) Yes, the child's read operation will affect the parent's read operation. 
This is because the file descriptor will point to where the last read operation finished reading bytes.
